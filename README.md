# What is mutagen?

mutagen is an html form that mints nft's and an accompanying nft contract that allows for updatable nft metadata and internal grouping (multiple forms)

Some early tools have also been made, like a tool that can redirect you to a link that was filled in...

This can be used for did-a-thing forms where people want to submit work, or profile pages anything where users have to enter data

forms have a simple schema system rolled out to make building them painless

Internal collections can be listed, meaning you can output form entries for its internal forms
